School
======

I'm open sourcing my education.


Why am I doing this?
--------------------

School sucks. This is my attempt to make it more enjoyable for myself. I'm
challenging myself to modernize my education by taking advantage of the
technology available.


Tools
-----

* Git (of course)
* Github - repository host
* vim - viewing/taking notes
* LaTeX - reports/papers
* Julia - technical computing
* Sage - calculations


Cheating
--------

I am making my coursework available under the assumption that it will not be
plagiarized, use to cheat, or used for other malicious activities.


Pull Requests
-------------

I will gladly accept pull requests to improve the quality of past work. Pull
requests for current/ongoing work will not be accepted unless otherwise stated.
