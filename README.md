School
======

I'm open sourcing my education.


Why am I doing this?
--------------------

School sucks. This is my attempt to make it more enjoyable for myself. I'm
challenging myself to modernize my education by taking advantage of the
technology available.


Tools
-----

* Git (of course)
* Github - repository host
* vim - viewing/taking notes
* LaTeX - reports/papers
* R with ggplot2 or gnuplot - plotting charts
* Sage - calculations
