I'm open sourcing my education.

## Why am I doing this?

I'm challenging myself to modernize my education by taking advantage of
technology available.

## Tools

* Git (of course)
* GitHub - repository host
* vim - viewing/taking notes
* LaTeX - reports/papers
* Julia - technical computing

## Plagiarism

I am making my coursework available under the assumption that it will not be
plagiarized. Doing so is in violation of the MIT license.

## Pull Requests

I will gladly accept pull requests to improve the quality of past work. Pull
requests for current/ongoing work will not be accepted unless otherwise stated.
