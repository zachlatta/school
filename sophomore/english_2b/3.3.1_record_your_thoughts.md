# 3.3.1 Journal: Record Your Thoughts

## Assignment

How do you define the word unprofessional? Describe the kinds of social media
posts or images that you think might look unprofessional to a prospective
employer. Explain your answer.

## Response

I define the word unprofessional as using the wrong context and personality in
the wrong situations. I believe someone can be immature without being
unprofessional. I also believe that someone should be able to post anything
on social networks (within reason, if they're public) without being considered
unprofessional. Employers have no right to look at their employees' online
presences. When I first started getting clients, I was only in the 7th or 8th
grade. I acted relatively immature on Facebook and Twitter, but treated my
clients completely different than my friends. I think that in no way was I
unprofessional, especially given my age.
