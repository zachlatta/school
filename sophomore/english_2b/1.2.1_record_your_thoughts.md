# 1.2.1. Journal: Record Your Thoughts

I strongly believe that education extends far beyond what is taught in
school. Far too often I find my peers pigeonholing math to what happens in
pre-calculus, language to what happens in English 10, and science to what
happens in their chemistry class. I strongly believe that education can be a
mixing pot of knowledge, drawing connections between math and language,
science and the arts, truly creating an intricate nexus of connections.

Pigeonholing education to what happens in schools limits the mind.
