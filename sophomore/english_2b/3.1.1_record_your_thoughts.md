# 3.1.1 Journal: Record Your Thoughts

## Assignment

You're called to the principal's office, but you have no idea why she wants to
speak with you. What are some gestures, facial expressions, habits, or other
details that might help you figure out if she has good or bad news for you,
before she even speaks? How might the principal's body language give you a hint
about what she's going to say?

## Response

After being called into the principal's office, I'll pay close attention to her
body language. For example, if she slams her hands on her desk and has an angry
look on her face, chances are she's disappointed or angry about something. If
she has a puzzled expression on her face, she potentially wants to know more
about something. From her body language, I can infer her intent before she even
speaks a word. Back in the third grade my teacher asked to speak with me after
class. When I went to meet with her, she had a disappointed and angry look on
her face. From this, I inferred that she was disappointed and angry with me
about something. Body language is a huge part of everyday life.
