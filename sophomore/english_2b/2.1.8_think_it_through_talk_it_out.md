# 2.1.8 Discuss: Think It Through, Talk It Out

## Assignment

Read the claim below and then decide whether you agree or disagree with it.
Be prepared to support your opinion with details from the reading. Here's
the claim:

> The tone that politicians use when they speak has changed little since
> Jackson's time.

What do you think? Write a paragraph supporting your opinion, and then write
a reply paragraph. If you're working with others, your reply paragraph
should respond to the ideas of another student. If you're working alone,
your reply paragraph should support the opposite point of view from your
own.

## Response

I agree with the provided claim. I believe that the tone politicians use when
speaking has changed little since Jackson's time. Jackson speaks down to the
natives much like how our politicians speak down on those from other countries.
For example, in _On Indian Removal_, Jackson states, "It will place a dense and
civilized population in large tracts of country now occupied by a few savage
hunters." Jackson refers to the natives as "savage hunters" to justify removing
them from their homes for the "more civilized" white settlers.

I disagree with your assertions. Modern politicians have a much broader
world-view and are far more open to different ways of life. International law
has been established to prevent crimes against humanity from happening. The
horrific crimes Jackson oversaw would be outright unacceptable in a modern
context.
