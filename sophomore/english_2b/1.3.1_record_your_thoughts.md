# 1.3.1 Journal: Record Your Thoughts

## Assignment

You have to miss school, cancel a guitar lesson, and change the plans you made
with your friend because you are going to Hollywood to pick up a talent show
award. You decide to write individual messages to inform your teacher, your
guitar instructor, and your friend. How do you think the messages will differ?
How will the language change for each recipient? How will the way you present
the news change?

## Response

I believe the individual messages I write will be quite different from each
other. For example, I likely have a far more professional relationship with my
teacher than my friend. Because of this, the message to my teacher will use
formal writing while the message to my friend will be far more casual. I'll
present the information to my teacher through an email or letter with very
official notation, while I'll present the information to my friend through a
text message or IM.
