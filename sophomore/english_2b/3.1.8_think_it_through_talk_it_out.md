# 3.1.8 Discuss: Think It Through, Talk It Out

## Assignment

Read the statement below then decide whether you agree or disagree with it.
Be prepared to support your opinion with details from the speeches. Here's
your discussion prompt:

> David McCullough's point of view is too jaded; believing that one is
> special is necessary to be successful.

What do you think? Write a paragraph supporting your opinion and then write
a reply paragraph. If you're working with others, your reply paragraph
should respond to the ideas of another student. If you're working alone,
your reply paragraph should support the opposite point of view from your
own.

## Response

I disagree with David McCullough's assertion. Instead of the belief that one is
special, I believe a humble mind better helps achieve success. In President
Obama's speech, he says that hard work, not intelligence, achieves success.
The belief that one is special may lead to a lack of hard work, thus making
the achievement of success less likely.

I disagree with your disagreement. The belief that one is special is
fundamentally what creates drive. With drive comes passion. If someone doesn't
believe that they're special, then they have no incentive to go out of their
way to become successful.
