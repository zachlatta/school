# The Neolithic Revolution and the Birth of Civilization

* **Neolithic Age** - New Stone Age. Period in the development of human
  technology beginning about 10,200 BC and ending between 4,500 and 2,000 BC.
* Early man used tools to accomplish tasks.
  * One of many examples of this is using a fire-starting stick with the bloom
    stalk of a yucca plan to start a fire for warmth and meals.
* The capacity to fashion tools distinguishes human beings from other animals.
  * Although other animals, such as apes, use tools, only humans construct
    them.
* Knowing how to create fire is a discovery unique to humans.
  * The use of fire for cooking allowed early humans to eat a wide range of
    foods, particularly animal protein.
* Our early ancestors could talk.

## Human Life in the Era of Hunters and Gatherers

* **Big History** - furthers discussion of when and how the human species
  emerged and what impact it would have, over time, on the physical environment
  and on other species. In this approach human history fits into a larger
  pattern of terrestrial change.
* **Paleolithic Age** - Old Stone Age. Prehistoric period of human history
  distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools and covers
  99% of human technological prehistory.
* By the late Paleolithic Age in 12,000 BC, humans were evolved into roughly
  the same appearance and intelligence as today.
  * Homo sapiens, our species, had been competing with increasing success for
    game and campsites for nearly 100,000 years.
  * Standing in an upright position freed the hands of homo sapiens. The
    combination of freed hands with opposable thumbs and a large brain enabled
    different human species to make and use tool sand weapons of increasing
    sophistication.
    * These implements helped to offset the humans' lack of body strength and
      speed to rival predators, such as wolves and wild cats.
    * A more developed brain allowed humans to transform grunts and other
      into what is now known as language.
      * Language enabled advanced communication between humans which allowed
        greater cooperation and cohesion between small bands that were the 
        predominant form of human social organization.
* Humans evolved to produce offspring that did not develop mature teeth until
  well after weaning.
  * For human children to survive, their parents or other adults had to devote
    a much longer period to providing food. This caused family structures
    to develop accordingly.

### Paleolithic Culture

* During the late Paleolithic Age, human groups survived by combining hunting
  and fishing with the gather of wild fruits, berries, grains, and roots.
* Instead of using wood and bone for tools, humans were using stone tools.
* The late Paleolithic was a period of particularly intense artistic
  creativity.
  * Fine miniature sculpture, beads, carved bones, and other forms of jewelry
    have been found dating from this period.
  * The most striking works discovered at ancient dwelling sites are cave
    paintings.
    * Some of these paintings appear to have religious significance.
* The art of the Old Stone Age indicates that humans were becoming increasingly
  interested in leaving lasting images of their activities and concerns.

### The Spread of Human Culture

* Migration led to the early peopling of the world's major land masses.
  * It was essential whenever hunting and gathering populations expanded.
* The possession of fire and tools that made the creation of clothing and
  shelter possible enabled different human species to migrate away from their
  homelands.
* By the late Paleolithic Age, groups of humans had colonized all of the
  continents except Antarctica.

### Human Society and Daily Life at the End of the Paleolithic Age

* Although most human societies in the Paleolithic Age consisted of small
  hunter-gatherer groups, natural conditions and human ingenuity permitted
  some groups to establish settlements.
    * These communities survived by harvesting wild grains that grew in
      abundance.
    * Eventually some of these communities moved to true agriculture by
      domesticating plants and animals near their settlements.
* Few early hunter-gatherer bands could support more than 20-30 individuals
  due to their dependence on migrating herds.
* Labor within bands was divided according to gender.
  * Men - participated in hunting parties, protect band from animal predators
    and other bands
  * Women - prepared and preserved meat, gathered foods to provide when animal
    hunt parties weren't successfull, and use medicinal plants to treat disease
    and injuries.
  * Children - helped women with many tasks

### Settling Down: Dead Ends and Transitions

* Most humans lived in small hunting-and-gathering bands until well into the
  agrarian revolution.
* However, some prefarming peoples devised intensive hunting-and-gathering
  patterns that permitted them to establish semipermanent and permanent
  settlements to support larger and more complex forms of social organization.
* Some of the most sophisticated prefarming settlements were those of the
  Natufian complex, which extended over much of present-day Palestine, Israel,
  Jordan, and Lebanon.
  * Climate changes between 12,000 and 11,000 BC enabled wild grains to
    flourish in the area.
  * Between 10,500 and 8000 BC the Natufian culture flourished.
    * Population densities reached as high as six to seven times those of other
      early Neolithic communities.
  * There is evidence that Natufian society was matrilocal and matrilineal.
    * **matrilocal** - of or denoting a custom in marriage whereby the husband
      goes to live with the wife's community
    * **matrilineal** - of or based on kinship with the mother or the female
      line
  * The Natufian survival strategy placed a heavy dependence on intense
    gathering of wild grains and improvement of storage techniques.
    Unfortunately the reliance on intense gathering of wild grains caused times
    of great hardship when the climate started to become more and more arid
    after 9000 BC. One thousand years later, all the Natufian sites had been
    abandoned.

### A Precarious Existence

* The progression of human technology advancement was remarkably slow until the
  late Paleolithic Age.
* It is likely that no more than 8 million people lived worldwide on the eve of
  agriculture.
* Life in the Paleolithic was short and violent. Those who lived in permanent
  settlements created heavy reliances on gathering techniques that worked to
  their demise when climate or migration patterns changed.

## Agriculture and the Origins of Civilization: The Neolithic Revolution

* Between 8000 and 3500 BCE increasing numbers of humans moved from hunting and
  gathering to depending on cultivated crops and domesticated animals for
  sustenance.
* By 7000 BCE technology had developed enabling towns of over 1000 to be
  formed.
  * Jericho in the valley of the Jordan River and Çatal Hüyük in present-day
    Turkey are both examples of large towns that formed.
* Climate changes associated with the retreat of glaciers late in the last ice
  age (from about 12,000 BCE), may have prompted the migration of many big
  game animals to new pasture lands in the north. 
* Climatic shifts also led to changes in the distribution and growing patterns
  of wild grains and other crops on which hunters and gatherers depended.
* It is likely that the shift to sedentary farming was prompted by concentrated
  population increases.
  * Population increase likely occurred when more attention was devoted to the
    collection of wild grains, which eventually led to the concious and
    systematic cultivation of plants and, thus, the **Neolithic revolution**.

### The Domestication of Plants and Animals

* **Neolithic revolution** - the critical transformation in human culture
  caused by the discovery of agriculture and domestication of animals
* The move to agriculture was extremely gradual.
  * Early experimenters always continued hunting and gathering to survive.
* As the Stone Age peoples became more adept and cultivating a growing range
  of craps, the effort they expended on activities outside of agriculture
  diminished.
  * Some bands chose to settle down, others practiced a mix of hunting and
    **shifting cultivation** that allowed them to continue to move about.
* Several animals were domesticated before the discovery of agriculture.
  * Around 12,000 BC in east Asia it was discovered that wolf pups could be
    trained to track and corner game.
  * Other animals domesticated include sheep, goats, pigs, and, later, horned
    cattle.
* Domesticated animals, such as cattle and sheep, provided New Stone Age humans
  with meat, milk, and materials.
  * Animal hides and wool greatly expanded potential for tool creation
    (shelter, clothing, etc).
  * Animals were not commonly used for transportation.
* The domestication of animals increased the incidence of disease.
  * Up to 80 percent of all human diseases came originally from animals.

### The Spread of the Neolithic Revolution

* Requiring a large amount of labor for little immediate return prevented many
  bands from moving to agriculture.
* Sedentary agricultural communities coexisted with more numerous bands of
  hunters and gatherers throughout most of the Neolithic Age.
* The domestication of animals gave rise to pastoralism, which has proved to be
  the strongest competitor to sedentary agriculture as a way of life throughout
  most of the world.
  * **Pastoralism** - a nomadic herding way of life
    * Has thrived in semiarid areas such as Asia, the Sudanic belt south of the
      Sahara desert, and the zavanna zone of easy and south Africa.
* Bands that continued to hunt and gather for food maintained military power
  that allowed them to fight with and raid agricultural settlements.

### The Transformation of Material Life

* With the development of agriculture, humans began to transform more and more
  of the environment they lived in.
  * Sedentary farmers cleared nearby land to be used for controlled planting.
* Prior to farming the global human population fluctuated between 5 and 8
  million. After four or five millenia of farming, their numbers had risen to
  60 or 70 million.
* By 4000 BCE, villages and cultivated fields became the dominant features of
  human habitation over much of the globe.
* The sudden surge in invention and social complexity in the Neolithic Age
  marks one of the great turning points in human history. Advanced tools
  allowed the human population to grow, technology to advance further, and
  the formation of complex societies.

### Social Differentiation

* The surplus production made possible by agriculture allow role-based
  societies to form.
* Originally, each household crafted the tools and weapons it needed. Over
  time, however, families or individuals who proved particularly skilled in
  these tasks began to manufacture implements beyond their own needs and to
  exchange them for other necessities.
* Sometimes villages would have a specialty, such as flint. The people of the
  village would exchange flint with other villages for necessities that they
  didn't readily have available.
* Leadership was largely communal in Neolithic times.
  * Property was also likely communal. At least access to village lands.
* Although women played a key part in the domestication of plants, their
  socioeconomic position of women began to decline with the shift to sedentary
  agriculture.
  * They worked the fields and have continued to work them in most cultures.

## The First Towns: Seedbeds of Civilization

* Two of the earliest settlements were at Jericho, in present-day Palestine,
  and at Çatal Hüyük, in present-day Turkey. Their populations were about 2000
  and 5000 people, respectively.
  * They represent the first stirrings of urban life.

### Jericho

* Economy based primarily on wheat and barley farming.
  * There is considerable evidence of reliance on hunting and trade.
* Town was governed by a distinct and powerful ruling group.
* Had specialized artisans and a small merchant class.

### Çatal Hüyük

* Founded around 7000 BCE.
* Most advanced human center of the Neolithic Age.
* Had powerful ruling group.
* A powerful priesthood existed.
  * We know this because of shrines found in the village.
* Had cult shrines and elaborate burial practices, which reveals the growing
  role of religion in the lives of Neolithic peoples.
* Had much broader and richer economic base than Jericho.
  * Hunting remained important, but the breeding of goats, sheep, and cattle
    vastly surpassed that associated with Jericho.
* Trade was extensive with the peoples in the surrounding hills and also in
  places as distant as present-day Syria and the Mediterranean region.

## The 4th Millennium BCE: Another Watershed

* The years from 4000 to 3000 BCE saw a second wave of major transformations in
  human culture in the Middle East and nearby regions.
  * The use of the plow significantly increased crop yields.
  * Wheeled vehicles made it possible to carry more food and other raw
    materials over greater distances.
  * The discovery of bronze.
    * Stronger tools and weapons.
* Better tools and weapons facilitated the rise of more centralized and
  expansive states.
  * Usually centered on fortified towns and cities.
  * Greatly increased contacts between farming and nomadic peoples in
    everything from war and conquest to trade and religious expression.
* New modes of transportation extended the reach of trade with other groups.
  * Cross-cultural exchanges between more complex for the societies that
    participated in them.
* Development of writing.
  * Greatly improved communications and exchange.
  * Enhanced power of the political elites.
  * Played a key role in the emergence of each of the transcultural religions
    that arose in the ancient and classical eras.
