# The Neolithic Revolution and the Birth of Civilization

* **Neolithic** - New Stone Age
* Early man used tools to accomplish tasks.
  * One of many examples of this is using a fire-starting stick with the bloom
    stalk of a yucca plan to start a fire for warmth and meals.
* The capacity to fashion tools distinguishes human beings from other animals.
  * Although other animals, such as apes, use tools, only humans construct
    them.
* Knowing how to create fire is a discovery unique to humans.
  * The use of fire for cooking allowed early humans to eat a wide range of
    foods, particularily animal protein.
