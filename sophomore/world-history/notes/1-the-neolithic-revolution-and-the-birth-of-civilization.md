# The Neolithic Revolution and the Birth of Civilization

* **Neolithic Age** - New Stone Age. Period in the development of human
  technology beginning about 10,200 BC and ending between 4,500 and 2,000 BC.
* Early man used tools to accomplish tasks.
  * One of many examples of this is using a fire-starting stick with the bloom
    stalk of a yucca plan to start a fire for warmth and meals.
* The capacity to fashion tools distinguishes human beings from other animals.
  * Although other animals, such as apes, use tools, only humans construct
    them.
* Knowing how to create fire is a discovery unique to humans.
  * The use of fire for cooking allowed early humans to eat a wide range of
    foods, particularily animal protein.
* Our early ancestors could talk.

## Human Life in the Era of Hunters and Gatherers

* **Big History** - furthers discussion of when and how the human species
  emerged and what impact it would have, over time, on the physical environment
  and on other species. In this approach human history fits into a larger
  pattern of terrestrial change.
* **Paleolithic Age** - Old Stone Age. Prehistoric period of human history
  distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools and covers
  99% of human technological prehistory.
* By the late Paleolithic Age in 12,000 BC, humans were evolved into roughly
  the same appearance and intelligence as today.
  * Homo sapiens, our species, had been competing with increasing success for
    game and campsites for nearly 100,000 years.
  * Standing in an upright position freed the hands of homo sapiens. The
    combination of freed hands with opposable thumbs and a large brain enabled
    different human species to make and use tool sand weapons of increasing
    sophistication.
    * These implements helped to offset the humans' lack of body strength and
      speed to rival predators, such as wolves and wild cats.
    * A more developed brain allowed humans to transform grunts and other
      into what is now known as language.
      * Language enabled advanced communication between humans which allowed
        greater cooperation and cohesion between small bands that were the 
        predominant form of human social organization.
* Humans evolved to produce offspring that did not develop mature teeth until
  well after weaning.
  * For human children to survive, their parents or other adults had to devote
    a much longer period to providing food. This caused family structures
    to develop accordingly.

### Paleolithic Culture

* During the late Paleolithic Age, human groups survived by combining hunting
  and fishing with the gather of wild fruits, berries, grains, and roots.
* Instead of using wood and bone for tools, humans were using stone tools.
* The late Paleolithic was a period of particularly intense artistic
  creativity.
  * Fine miniature sculpture, beads, carved bones, and other forms of jewelry
    have been found dating from this period.
  * The most striking works discovered at ancient dwelling sites are cave
    paintings.
    * Some of these paintings appear to have religious significance.
* The art of the Old Stone Age indicates that humans were becoming increasingly
  interested in leaving lasting images of their activities and concerns.

### The Spread of Human Culture

* Migration led to the early peopling of the world's major land masses.
  * It was essential whenever hunting and gathering populations expanded.
* The possession of fire and tools that made the creation of clothing and
  shelter possible enabled different human species to migrate away from their
  homelands.
* By the late Paleolithic Age, groups of humans had colonized all of the
  continents except Antarctica.

### Human Society and Daily Life at the End of the Paleolithic Age

* Although most human societies in the Paleolithic Age consisted of small
  hunter-gatherer groups, natural conditions and human ingenuity permitted
  some groups to establish settlements.
    * These communities survived by harvesting wild grains that grew in
      abundance.
    * Eventually some of these communities moved to true agriculture by
      domesticating plants and animals near their settlements.
* Few early hunter-gatherer bands could support more than 20-30 individuals
  due to their dependence on migrating herds.
* Labor within bands was divided according to gender.
  * Men - participated in hunting parties, protect band from animal predators
    and other bands
  * Women - prepared and preserved meat, gathered foods to provide when animal
    hunt parties weren't successfull, and use medicinal plants to treat disease
    and injuries.
  * Children - helped women with many tasks

### Settling Down: Dead Ends and Transitions

* Most humans lived in small hunting-and-gathering bands until well into the
  agrarian revolution.
* However, some prefarming peoples devised intensive hunting-and-gathering
  patterns that permitted them to establish semipermanent and permanent
  settlements to support larger and more complex forms of social organization.
* Some of the most sophisticated prefarming settlements were those of the
  Natufian complex, which extended over much of present-day Palestine, Israel,
  Jordan, and Lebanon.
  * Climate changes between 12,000 and 11,000 BC enabled wild grains to
    flourish in the area.
  * Between 10,500 and 8000 BC the Natufian culture flourished.
    * Population densities reached as high as six to seven times those of other
      early Neolithic communities.
  * There is evidence that Natufian society was matrilocal and matrilineal.
    * **matrilocal** - of or denoting a custom in marriage whereby the husband
      goes to live with the wife's community
    * **matrilineal** - of or based on kinship with the mother or the female
      line
  * The Natufian survival strategy placed a heavy dependence on intense
    gathering of wild grains and improvement of storage techniques.
    Unfortunately the reliance on intense gathering of wild grains caused times
    of great hardship when the climate started to become more and more arid
    after 9000 BC. One thousand years later, all the Natufian sites had been
    abandoned.

### A Precarious Existence

* The progression of human technology advancement was remarkably slow until the
  late Paleolithic Age.
* It is likely that no more than 8 million people lived worldwide on the eve of
  agriculture.
* Life in the Paleolithic was short and violent. Those who lived in permanent
  settlements created heavy reliances on gathering techniques that worked to
  their demise when climate or migration patterns changed.
