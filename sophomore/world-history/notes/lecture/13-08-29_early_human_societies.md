# Early Human Societies

## Paleolithic Age "Old Stone Age"
c. 4 million to c. 8,000 BCE

* Starts off with early homids, finishes with homo sapiens (us today).
  * Early homids were very ape-like.
* Humans change their environment signifantly, differing them from other
  animals.
* Neanderthals
  * Neander Valley, Germany.
* Nobody knows why the Neanderthals disappeared.

### Developments of Paleolithic Age

* 12,000 BCE - humans evolved to where we are today.
  * Opposable thumbs & developed brain
* Paleolithic achievements
  * Tools
  * Language
  * Control of fire (750,000 years ago)
  * Art
* Humans lived in small bands of hunter gatherers.

### Hunter-Forager Societies

* Men hunt/fish, human gather fruits, etc
  * Relatively egalitarian
  * Fishing was the most reliable source of meat.
    * Communities tended to stay near the shore because of this.
* Lived in kinship groups of 20-30
* Follow migratory paterns of animals
* Needed large potions of land to support themselves
* Short life expectancy
  * Average length of life was in the 20s.
* Groups traded with neighboring groups when necessary
* Practiced animism

## Neolithic Revolution "New Stone Age"
c. 8,000 - 3,500 BCE

* Around 10,000 BCE, two discoveries revolutionized human society
  * Farming (1st crops were wheat and barley)
    * Developed in Middle East - Turkey, Iraq, and Israel (Fertile Crescent)
  * Herding (1st domesticated animals were dogs, sheep, goats, pigs, and 
    cattle)
    * Pastoralists

* Farming and herding allowed for urban development
  * 1st cities emerged in Middle East (Turkey & Jordan)
  * Jericho and Catal Huyuk.

### Initial Development of Agriculture

* End of Ice Age
  * Population increases from better weather
  * Extinction of big game animals - Mastodon
  * More reliable source of food
    * Wild grains, berries, and nuts
  * Dependently and Independently

### Pastoral Societies

* Nomadic peoples who herd domesticated animals
* Move in search of food for their animals.
  * Traditionally more stable than hunter-gatherer societies.
* Develop on marginal land apart from areas suitable for agriculutre, often
  semi-arid regions.
  * Interactw with agricultural societies.
* Negative effects on fragile grasslands from overgrazing.
* Lived in kin-related bands, numbering up to 100
* Tribal membership was defined by recognizing a common ancestry among kinship
  groups
* "Courage Cultures"
  * Warlike males bound to each other by ties of personal loyalty tended to
    dominate these societies.
  * Violence between kinship groups limited the ability of clans and tribes
  to cooperate.
* Most practice a form of animism or shamanism

### Early Villages

* Earliest villages located in the Middle East.
* Population of early villages evolved from the hundreds to the thousands.
* Probably declined due to environmental degradation.

#### Life in Early Villages

* Full-time political and religious figures emerge as community leaders.
* Specilized workers such as toolmakers, miners, and merchants
* Despite specialization well-defined social stratification did not exist.
* Farming & specializaiton of labor led to decline in the role of women.
* Farming & specialized labor led to increase in technology
  * Pottery, the plow, irrigation, woven textiles, wheeled vehicles

### Social Differentiation

* Specialized occupations
* Regional exchange of goods
* Communal ownership
* Hierarchical social structures
  * Patriarchal
* Elite groups with "weath"

## Rise of Civilizations
4th Millennium BCE

* New discoveries transformed permanent settlements into civilizations
  * Bronze
  * Writing
* First civilization emerged in Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq) c. 3500 BCE
