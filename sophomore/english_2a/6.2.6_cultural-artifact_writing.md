# Practice: Cultural-Artifact Writing

I received the KwikKey from my mother years ago, back when I was young. My
great-grandfather had invented it to help the blind keep track of keys, back in
the early twentieth century, when the dreams of the industrial revolution were
in full-swing.H enry Ford started the industrial revolution, contributing to my
great-grandfather's want to invent. He invented the KwikKey, patented it, and
promptly brought it to market. Despite not selling well, the KwikKey symbolizes
the innate need to innovate throughout the generations in my family. My
great-grandfather invented and patented objects, I write and publish software.
