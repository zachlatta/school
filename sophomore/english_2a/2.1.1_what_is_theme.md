# 2.1.1 Study: What Is Theme?

## Subject

Simple subject - word expression that tells what something is all about.

## Theme

The idea about the subject that can be found with a deeper look.

## Moral

A lesson to be learned. Morals are not usually found outside of children's
literature and some essays. You should not express a theme as a moral.

## Perspective

The way you look at things; this is affected by beliefs, gender, age, social
status, life experiences, etc.

## Tips for Finding and Expressing Theme in Literature

1. Start by looking for language, images, or ideas that are repeated.
2. State the theme in one sentence.
3. State the theme in general terms. Make sure all people can relate to it.
