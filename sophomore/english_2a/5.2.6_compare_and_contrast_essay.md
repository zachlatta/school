### Parts of Essay

#### Hook/Intro

**Write a hook and an introductory paragraph that briefly describes the two
stories you will compare and constrast. Your thesis should focus on how the
idea of home is presented in the stories.**

"Home is where the heart is." Homes--permanent settlements--have been a
defining of mankind since the dawn of history.  Both _La Puerta_, by José
Antonio, and _Home_, by Gwendolyn Brooks, illustrate the social dynamics and
consequences of losing a home. In _La Puerta_, Sinesio must leave his home in
Mexico to work in the United States. Meanwhile, in _Home_, Papa is away getting
and extension for his family's home loan. If he fails to get the extension,
he'll lose the house. Despite having relatively different plots and characters,
both stories illustrate the meaning of home to mankind.

#### Body Paragraph

**In complete sentences, write your first body paragraph here. Discuss how
the writers' approaches are similar.**

Both _La Puerta_ and _Home_ epitomize the importance of home to mankind. Both
stories illustrate the social consequences of leaving home. Sinesio must leave
his home to provide for his family. Although not explicitly stated, the
emotional toll on him was immense. Similarly in _Home_, an immense emotional
toll is placed upon the women when the possibility of losing their home arises.
Both homes are by no means perfect, but they clearly have substantial worth to
the characters in both stories. Despite the home in _La Puerta_ being described
as as "ramshackle" and having "tin, wooden and cardboard roofs", it clearly has
immense emotional value to Sinesio and his family. Similarly, the home in
_Home_ is described as ugly and is difficult to make a fire in, yet it Papa
"lives for this house!" The outcomes in both _La Puerta_ and _Home_ are
relatively positive. In _La Puerta_, Sinesio discovers that he purchased the
winning lottery ticket. Papa, in _Home_, ends up getting the extension on his
mortgage loan.

#### Body Paragraph

**In complete sentences, write your second body paragraph here. Discuss how
the writers' approaches are different.**

The plot and character portrayal varies significantly between the two stories.
Sinesio has unrealistic hopes, exemplified by his purchase of a
lottery ticket with his meager wages. Meanwhile, Mama, in _Home_, is neither
hopeful nor realistic; when confronted with what to do if the house was lost,
she decided that the family would live in a nice flat, one that Papa could not
afford. Along with trait differences, the characters in both stories have
different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Sinesio reigns from an
impoverished region of Mexico. He works in a mattress sweat shop and is barely
able to feed his family from paycheck to paycheck. Papa, on the other hand,
lives in a relatively low-class neighborhood, likely in the United States.
Despite likely living from paycheck to paycheck, his family is not completely
impoverished.

#### Conclusion

**Write a concluding paragraph here. It should summarize your main points
and restate your thesis.**

Both _La Puerta_ and _Home_ show that home is a very moving theme. Despite
the differences between characters, the tone of both stories shows that home
truly has a place in everyone's heart.
