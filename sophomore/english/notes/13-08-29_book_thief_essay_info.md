### Quotes

Retells stories to...

"I carry, each one extraordinary in its own right. Each one an attempt -- an
immense leap of an attempt -- *to prove to me that you, and your human
existence, are worth it.*" (21)


Death's existence in every person...

"You want to know what I truly look like? I'll help you out. Find yourself a
mirror while I continue." (306)


Death isn't a person, but he is linked to all of humanity. He doesn't cause
people to die, but exists as a result...

"Please, be calm, despite that previous threat. I am all bluster-- I am not
violent. I am not malicious. I am a result." (13)


Death has human qualities, but he is not human himself.

"I am haunted by humans." (540)


Death is what makes us human.
