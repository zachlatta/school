## Paragraph

The creation of the Roman Empire was no mistake; Rome had set itself up for
success. A strong, powerful leader, in this case Alexander the Great, united
the army to fight for a single cause, increasing moral and loyalty. Utilizing
a highly-trained professional army allowed Alexander to both expand the empire
and protect existing interests. By hiring local indigenous mercenaries, he
cost-efficiently expanded his army without increasing the populace. Finally, by
utilizing and building roads, Alexander and his army were able to quickly move
from place to place, making his army one of the most mobile. The Roman Empire's
unprecedented success continue to influence Western civilization even today.
