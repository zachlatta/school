    Within plum orchard,
    Sturdy oak takes no notice
    Of flowering blooms.
    The moon glows the same:
    It is the drifting cloud forms
    Make it seem to change.
    Yellow rose petals
    Drop one-by-one in silence:
    Roar of waterfall.
    An old pond
    A frog jumps inâ€“
    The sound of water.
    In the falling snow
    A laughing boy holds out his palm
    Until they are white
