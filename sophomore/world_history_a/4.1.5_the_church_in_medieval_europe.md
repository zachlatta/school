# 4.1.5 Practice: The Church in Medieval Europe

The Roman Catholic Church was extremely important to the European Middle Ages.
When the world seemed like it had collapsed, the Church stood strong and served
as a source of stability. As more and more people turned to the Church, it
acquired immense power and eventually turned to corruption.

The Church was reminiscent of a more stable time, causing people from all walks
off life to turn to it. As the Church grew in size, it also grew in power. The
pope eventually became more powerful than the king. Pope Gregory VII pushed for
unprecedented reforms, including forbidding priests from marrying, and
outlawing the selling of Church offices. He also banned kings from appointing
Church officials. This banning angered Henry IV. Henry considered it his duty
to appoint Church officials. Gregory eventually excommunicating him from the
Church, asserting his power over him. Power turned to corruption when some
members of the clergy no longer upheld their religious responsibilities and
began living lives of luxury. The selling of indulgences highlights the
corruption in the Church at its worst.

Through the course of the Middle Ages, what was once a source of stability
turned into a powerhouse of corruption.
