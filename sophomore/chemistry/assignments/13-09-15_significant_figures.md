Addition and Subtraction: For the following problems, first complete the math,
then round appropriately for the correct significant figures.

1. 45.2+7.12+1.009= 
2. 97.98-14.6-6=    
3. 1,000.001+24.3-5.1=  
4. 604.32-78.099+3.2= 
5. 7-5.22+1.2=    

Multiplication and Division: For the following problems, first complete the
math, then round appropriately for the correct significant figures.

1. 45.2×7.12×1.009= 
2. 97.98÷14.6÷6=    
3. 1,000.001×24.3÷5.1=  
4. 604.32÷78.099×3.2= 
5. 7÷5.22×1.2=    

Now continue practicing but pay attention to the type of math required and use
the appropriate rule.  Remember your order of operations.

1. 5.03×1025 ÷ 1.002×107= 
2. 0.001524 - 5.36 + 12.255=  
3. 79,000 × 0.045 × 1.23=   
4. 304.0 - 123.54 - 0.0020= 
5. 290 ÷ 15 × 0.009=    
6. 903.65 ÷ 2 ÷ 1.44=   
7. 9,000.0 - 5.295 + 8.333= 
8. 1003.03 – 45.25 + 2.22=  
9. 7.65×105 + 2.345×104=    
10. 500.0 - 1.52×10-4=
