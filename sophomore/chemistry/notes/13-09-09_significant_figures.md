# Significant Figures

* Rule 1: Nonzero numbers are always significant
* Rule 2: All ending zeroes to the right of the decimal are significant.
* Rule 3: Any zeroes between significant numbers are significant.
* Rule 4: All zeroes at the front of a number or at the end of a number to the
  left of the decimal are NOT significant (unless precisely measured).
* Rule 5: Counting numbers (things that only come in while numbers) have an
  infinite number of significant figures.

## Adding and Subtracting Significant Figures

* When adding and subtracting, the answer must have only as many decimals as
  the number with the fewest decimals.

## Multiplying and Dividing Significant Figures

* When multiplying/dividing, the answer must be only as many significant
  figures as the number with the fewest significant figures.

## Mixture of Multiplication/Division and Addition/Subtraction

* Use the order of operations.
  * After each order of operation, round appropriately.
