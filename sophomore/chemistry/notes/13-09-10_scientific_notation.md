# Scientific Notation

* Scientific notation only represents significant figures.
  * So if you see a number in scientific notation, the number of numbers you
    see is the number of significant figure.

## How to do scientific notation?

* Example: number larger than 1
  * ![](http://tex.sh/$1,327.98$): move decimal until only 1 number in front of
    it (3 times to the left in this one).
  * ![](http://tex.sh/$1.32798 add 10^n$): where n represents the number of
    decimal places shifted
  * ![](http://tex.sh/$1.32798*10^3$): final
* Example: number samller than 1
  * ![](http://tex.sh/$0.000798$): move decimal until only 1 number in front of
    it (4 times to the right in this one)
  * ![](http://tex.sh/$7.98*10^{-n}$): where n represents the number of decimal
    places shifted
  * ![](http://tex.sh/$7.98*10^{-4}$): final
