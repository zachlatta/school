# Agile Web Development with Ruby on Rails

* Rails is a Ruby framework for Agile web development.

## Why Use Frameworks?

* Key points
  * Structure
  * Modularity
  * Abstraction
  * Encapsulation
* Frameworks make code **mantainable**.

## What is Agile?

* "Done is better than perfect."
* "Convention over configuration."
* DRY code

## Architectures

* MVC (model, view, controller)
  * Allows different groups to work on the same application concurrently.

### Model

* Rails's ORM (object-relational mapping) is called ActiveRecord
  * An ORM maps objects to a database.

### Controller

* Encapsulate the methods in app logic
* Acts as a layer between models and views

### View

* Presentation, design, and styling
