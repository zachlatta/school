# Power of Patterns: Refactoring to (or away from) Patterns

* **Pattern** - a solution to a pattern in a context
* **Refactor** - change code without changing it
  * Change how the code does what it does, not what it does

## Patterns

### XP Simple Design

1. Passes all tests
2. Code is clear, expressive, consistent
3. No duplications (DRY)
4. Minimal

## Anti-Patterns

### Golden Hammer

* **Golden hammer** - thinking that one thing is the right job for everything.
* There is no golden hammer. Ever.
