What is Biology?
================

* The principles and concepts of biological science explain nature’s puzzles.


The Science of Biology
----------------------

* The concepts, principles, and theories that allow people to understand the
  natural environment for the core of **biology**, the study of life.

* A key part of biology is learning about the different kinds of living things
  around you.

* General biological principles and rules are developed from the answers to
  questions about life.


### Biologists study the interactions of life

* *Living things do not live in isolation; they are all functioning parts in
   the delicate balance of nature.*

* Living things depend on other living and nonliving things in a variety of
  ways and for a variety of reasons.

# Biologists Study the Diversity of Life

* Many individuals study biology simply for the pleasure or learning about the
  world of living things.


### Biologists study the interactions of the environment

* Because no species can exist in isolation, biology includes the investigation
  of the interaction between species.

* *The study of one species always involves the study of other species with
   which it interacts.*


### Biologists study problems and propose solutions

* Biological research can lead to advances in medical treatment and disease
  prevention in humans and other species.

* The study of biology will teach you how humans function and we fit into the
  rest of the natural world. It will also equip you with the knowledge required
  to sustain this planet’s web of life.


Characteristics of Living Things
--------------------------------

* Biologists have a formulated list of characteristics by which we can
  recognize living things.

    * To be considered living, something has possess all of the
      characteristics.

* Anything that possesses all of the characteristic of life is known as an
  **organism**.

* All living things have an orderly structure, produce offspring, grow and
  develop, and adjust to changes in the environment.


### Living things are organized

* All livings things show an orderly structure, or **organization**.

* All living things are composed of cells. Each cell contains the genetic
  matter, or DNA, that provides all of the information needed to control the
  organism’s life processes.

* All living things, despite their number of cells, have parts that function
  together in an orderly, living system.


### Living things make more living things

* **Reproduction** is the production of offspring.

* Although reproduction is not essential for the survival of an individual
  organism, it is essential for the continuation of the organism’s species.

* A **species** is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile
  offspring in nature.


### Living things change during their lives

* All organisms’ lives originate from a single cell that grows and takes on the
  characteristics of its species.

* **Growth** results in an increase in the amount of living material and the
  formation of new structures.

* All of the changes that take place during the live of an organism are known
  as its **development**.


### Living things adjust to their surroundings

* An organism’s surroundings are known as their **environment**.

    * An organism’s environment includes the air, water, weather, temperature,
      and other organisms in the area, and many other factors.

* Any condition in the environment that requires an organism to adjust is a
  **stimulus.** A reaction to a stimulus is a **response**.

* The ability to respond to stimuli in the environment is an important
  characteristic of living things.

    * Many of the structures and behaviours of organisms enable them to adjust
      to the environment.

* **Homeostasis** is the regulation of an organism’s internal environment to
  maintain conditions suitable for its survival.

    * Homeostasis is a characteristic of life because it is a process that
      occurs in all living things.

* Living things reproduce themselves, grow and develop, respond to external
  stimuli, and maintain homeostasis by using **energy**. Energy is the ability
  to do work.

    * Organisms get their energy from food.


### Living things adapt and evolve

* Any structure, behavior, or internal process that enables an organism to
  respond to stimuli and better survive in an environment is called an
  **adaptation**.

    * Adaptations are inherited from previous generations.

    * Individuals with more suitable adaptations are more likely to survive and
      reproduce.

    * As a result, individuals with these adaptations become more numerous in
      the population.

* The gradual accumulation of adaptations over time is **evolution**.
