The Methods of Biology
======================

* Biologists use different methods while researching. However, all scientific
  inquiries share some methods in common.


Observing and Hypothesizing
---------------------------

* Curiosity drives biologists to try to answer simple questions about everyday
  observations.

    * The answers to these questions often times provide a better understanding
      of general biological principles and may even lead to practical
      applications.

* The knowledge gained when a scientist answers a question often generates
  other questions or proves useful in solving other problems.


### The methods biologists use

* The common steps that biologists and other scientists use to gather
  information and answer questions are **scientific methods**.

* Scientists often identify problems to solve simply by observing the world
  around them.


### The question of brown tree snakes

* A **hypothesis** is an explanation for a question or a problem that can be
  formally tested.

    * Hypothesizing is one of the methods most frequently used by scientists.

    * Until a scientist can propose a hypothesis that can be tested, they may
      propose suggestions to explain observations.

* A hypothesis is not a random guess. Hypotheses must be based on evidence.

* Before a scientist can propose a hypothesis, they have to have developed some
  sort idea of what the answer to a question by be through person observations,
  extensive reading, or previous experiments.

* After stating a hypothesis, a scientist may continue to make observations and
  form more hypotheses to account for the collected data.

* Hypotheses can be tested by conducting an experiment.

    * The results of the experiment will help the scientist draw a conclusion
      about whether or not the hypothesis is correct.


Experimenting
-------------

* An **experiment **is a procedure that tests a hypothesis by the process of
  collecting information under controlled conditions.


### What is a controlled experiment?

* Some experiments involve two ground: the control group and the experimental
  group.

    * The **control** is the group in which all conditions are kept the same.

    * The experimental group is the test group, in which all conditions are
      kept the same except for the single condition being tested.


### Designing an experiment

* The condition in an experiment that is changed is the **independent
  variable**, because it is the only variable that affects the outcome of the
  experiment.

* Any changes in the **dependent variable** depend on changes made to the
  independent variable.

* Controlled experiments are most often used in laboratory settings.

* Not all experiments are controlled.

    * An experiment that has no control is the type of biological investigation
      most often used in field work.

* The type of experiment used depends on the subject of the experiment and what
  other experimenters have done.


### Using tools

* Biologists use a wide variety of tools to obtain information in an
  experiment.

    * Some common tools include beakers, test tubes, hot plates, petri dishes,
      thermometers, dissecting instrument, balances, metric rulers, and
      graduation cylinders.

    * More complex tools include microscopes, centrifuges, radiation detectors,
      spectrophotometers, DNA analyzers, and gas chromatographs.


### Maintaining safety

* Safety is an important factor that scientists consider when carrying out
  experiments.

* Biologists try to minimize hazards to themselves, the people working around
  them, and the organisms they are studying.


### Data gathering

* Information obtained from experiments is called **data**.

    * Sometimes, data from experiments are referred to as experimental results.

* Having the data from an experiment does not end the scientific process.

    * Scientists often have more questions after analyzing the data.

    * They compare their results and conclusions with the results of other
      studies by researching the published literature for more information.


### Reporting results

* The results and conclusions of experiments are reported in scientific
  journals, where they are open to examination by other scientists.

    * Hundreds of scientific journals are published weekly or monthly.


### Verifying results

* After the results of an experiment are published, other scientists can try to
  verify the results by repeating the experiment.

    * If they obtain similar results, there is more evidence to support the
      hypothesis.

* When a hypothesis is supported by data from additional experiments, it is
  considered valid and is generally accepted by the scientific community.

    * When a scientist publishes the results of his or her investigation, other
      scientists can relate their own work to the published data.


### Thinking about what happened

* Often times the thing that takes most of a scientistâ€™s time is analyzing
  experimental data.

    * After careful analysis of the results, they must come to a conclusion:
      Was the hypothesis supported by the data? What is not supported? Is more
      data needed?

* A **theory** is an explanation of a natural phenomenon that is supported by a
  large body of scientific evidence obtained from many different investigations
  and observations.

    * A theory results from continual verification and refinement of a
      hypothesis.

* Laws or principles are certain facts of nature that are generally known to be
  true.
