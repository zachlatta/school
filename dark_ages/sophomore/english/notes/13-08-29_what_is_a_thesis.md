# What is a thesis?

## Good Thesis

* Always includes these components
  * POSITION/ARGUMENT - claim about the text (specific to the text)
  * RATIONALE/HOW? - the literary devices, concepts, general themes, etc, that
    you choose to prove your claim.
  * SO WHAT? - the significance of your idea in terms of understanding the text 
    as a whole (theme)
    * Answer should not be a generalization. It should be specific.
* Addreses the three questions of what? how? and why?

## Sample Thesis

**Thesis:** Mark Twain's *Huckleberry Finn* successfully depicts life in rural 
and "civilized" America.

* Issues
  * Opinionated - uses the word "successfully"
  * Missing a position (or subject)
  * There's no argument

**Fixed thesis:** Through its contrasting river and shore scenes, Twain's
*Huckleberry Finn* suggests that to find the true expression of American
ideals, man must leave civilized society and go back to nature.

The above can be used as a template for future theses.
