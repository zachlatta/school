* In 1817 Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded the first school for the deaf.
* The first college for the deaf, Gallaudet University, was founded in 1864.
* Alexander Graham Bell's wife and mother were deaf. He was very familiar with
  the deaf world.
  * He was against deaf people using sign to communicate, believing that it
    ostracized them from the rest of the world.
    * This caused the "dark ages" of deaf education.
  * He was very interested in eugenics, leading to the belief that deaf people
    were an insuperior race.
