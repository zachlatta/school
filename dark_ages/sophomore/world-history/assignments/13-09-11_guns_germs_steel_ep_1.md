# Viewing Guide: Guns, Germs, and Steel: Episode 1

**Directions:** Before viewing the film, read each question below so you know
what information and ideas you should be looking for as you watch Episode 1.
Record your answers to each question by providing as many facts, details, and
examples as possible to answer each question. Be prepared to discuss your
answers with the class and to use them as you work on a project.

1. According to Jared Diamond, what are the three major elements that separate
   the world’s “haves” from the “have nots”?
   * Guns, germs, and steel are the three major elements that separate the
     world's "haves" from the "have nots."
2. Jared Diamond refers to the people of New Guinea as “among the world’s most
   culturally diverse and adaptable people in the world”, yet they have much
   less than modern Americans.  Diamond has developed a theory about what has
   caused these huge discrepancies among different countries, and he says it
   boils down to geographic luck. Give several examples from the film to
   support Diamond’s theory.
   * Those who resided in the fertile crescent had access to significantly more
     resources than those living in New Guinea. Having more resources allowed
     civilizations in the fertile crescent to become more agrarian, leading to
     specialization. The lack of resources caused hunter-gatherer bands to
     continue to hunt and gather, preventing specialization and the development
     of advanced technology from ever happening.
3. For thousands of years, people have been cultivating crops. Describe the
   process used to domesticate crops and create plants that yielded bigger,
   tastier harvests.
   * By planting and harvesting at specific times, while selecting seeds from
     plants with favorable characteristics, humans were able to domesticate
     crops and pleants and induce artificial selection to get better yields.
4. According to Diamond, livestock also plays a significant role in a
   civilization’s ability to become rich and powerful. How did the
   domestication of animals help people? Give several examples.
   * The domestication of animals created a steady source of meat, skins, and
     other niceties. Animals were also used for transportation and in warfare
     along with farming.
5. List the animals that can be domesticated and where they can be found.
   * Goats, pigs, horses, donkeys, camels, pigs, reindeer, llama (South
     America), nithans, cattle, and yaks can all be domesticated. All of the
     animals besides llama  can be found in Asia, North Africa, and Europe.
6. Looking at the list of animals and locations from question 5, discuss how
   Diamond’s theory about geographic luck applies here.
   * Domesticated animals lead to more productive civilizations. It's not a
     coincidence that areas with notable civilizations all had domesticatable
     animals available.
7. How did the movement of the early civilizations of the Fertile Crescent
   (Middle East) further support Diamond’s idea that geography played a key
   role in the success of a civilization?
   * The people of the early civilizations of the Fertile Crescent abused the
     land, to the point where it could no longer support them. Since the
     Fertile Crescent shared that smae latitude with Europe and Asia, the
     people were able to migrate to new areas and thrive.
8. Do you agree with Jared Diamond when he says of a civilizations ability to
   gain power, wealth, and strength, “...what’s far more important is the hand
   that people have been dealt, the raw materials they’ve had at their
   disposal.” Why or why not?
   * I agree with Diamond. A huge part of a peoples' success is outside of
     their control. The geographic location of a people has an outstanding
     effect on their success. The people of the Fertile Crescent are a
     fantastic example of this. Their fortunate geographic positioning led to
     them developing specialization and other things vital to civilization.
