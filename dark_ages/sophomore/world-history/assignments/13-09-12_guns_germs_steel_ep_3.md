1. According to Jared Diamond, what is the one factor that allowed Europeans to
   develop the forces necessary to conquer vast portions of the world?
  * Ideal geographic position allowed Europeans to develop the forces necessary
    to conquer vast portions of the world.
2. Why were the Europeans who settled the South African cape so successful?
   Describe two reasons.
  * The temperature and climate in the South African cape are very similar to
    Europe's due to sharing a similar distance from the equator. Because of
    this, the crops and animals from back home could be grown and raised.
3. How did disease allow the Europeans to conquer the native populations in the
   Americas and in the African cape?
4. While the Europeans who were attempting to overtake/settle the tropical
   areas of the African continent were responsible for introducing killer germs
   to the native populations, they also suffered from the effects of the germs
   native to this part of the world. Describe how these germs worked against
   the European settlers.  
5. How did the native Africans protected themselves from the germs that caused
   diseases such as Smallpox and Malaria? Give specifi c examples cited in the

10. Describe how other tropical countries such as Malaysia and Singapore have
    developed rich economies despite having many of the same geographical and
health problems faced by African nations.
11. Now that you have read “The Story of Smallpox and Other Eurasian Germs”,
    describe what you have learned about Smallpox including the causes,
    symptoms, means for spreading the disease, and how immunity to the disease
    can be developed.

12. After reading “The Story of Malaria and Other Deadly Tropical Germs”, what
    are some of the effective, simple, relatively inexpensive ways to prevent
