## Professional Interview

* Please describe your engineering field. 
  * My field of expertise is software engineering.  If you boil the job down to
    its basics, it consists of: identifying a problem (or set of problems),
    theorizing solutions to those problems, designing logic between dependent
    systems in order to achieve the solution, and then implementing said
    solution in a programming language, such as C++ or Objective-C. 
* What is your current job title?
  * I am currently the Technical Director and President at Run Games LLC, a
    video game developer based in Los Angeles.
* Please describe your particular job and duties.
  * As Technical Director, I oversee all technical decisions for all products
    and I am typically the go-to person for technical questions about how a
    system works or how something can be solved.  I'm also the Lead Programmer
    for our current game, Football Heroes.  As Lead Programmer, I've engineered
    most of the core systems in game, such as: gameplay, networking,
    user interface, and rendering, to name a few.  I also coordinate with the
    Creative Director and Art Director to help shape the vision of the game,
    which is always fun!
  * As President, my main responsibilities are issuing payroll, managing
    company books, filing taxes, and some PR.  This type of work is a
    relatively new experience to me that I wasn't privy to before I ran a
    company, so there are definitely some growing pains.
* What is your average work schedule? 
  * My workload nowadays is pretty hefty due to finalizing Football Heroes.  My
    current schedule can typically be anywhere from 10 to 14 hours, working 6
    to 7 days a week.  But for the rest of the year (and on average),
    I work 8-9 hour days, 5 days a week.
  * My typical day has loaded with engineering tasks, game design and aesthetic
    decisions, as well as higher-level company operations.  
* Starting with high school, describe your educational background
  chronologically. 
  * I first started programming on game consoles back during my junior year of
    High School.  Thanks to the resources available on the Internet and by
    forcing myself to learn how to program on consoles, I quickly gained the
    knowledge and experience I need to get my foot in the video game industry.
    By the age of 19, I landed a job programming PlayStation games full-time in
    Montreal instead of going to college.  
  * In some ways, I regard my 4 years at that company (DC Studios) to be the
    equivalent of my higher education that some would find at a university,
    except I had quite a bit more real-world experience under my belt by the
    end of it.
* If you had it to do over, related to your career or education, would you do
  anything differently?
  * I would consider myself lucky that I achieved my dream job so early in
    life, but there are times that I wish I would of went to a university to
    learn some of the basics.  I often find myself at a loss with some
    mathematical equations and I'm sure I would of solved some things
    differently (and more efficiently) if I knew the intricacies a bit more.
* What advice would you give to me as someone interested in pursuing a career
  path similar to yours?  
  * There is so much more information out there on the Internet nowadays
    compared to when I started to teach myself programming in the late '90s.  
  * I believe with the educational resources that are available on the Internet
    and the distribution networks such as the App Store/Google Play, anyone can
be successful making software!  
  * I would say teach yourself what you want to know first, then do something
    with that self-taught knowledge that has an end result, like a project.
    All it takes the ability to have a vision, execute on that vision, and have
    the conviction to put in the hard work to finish what you started.

## Personal Reflection

* What surprised you most about the interview?
  * Nathan's success despite not attending college most surprised me.
* What was the most important piece of information that you learned from the
  interview?
  * I learned that a degree doesn't guarantee success. The software industry
    demands problem solvers, not those who can do coursework.
* How has this interview influenced your feelings about your future career?
  * This interview has reinforced my excitement to work in the software
    industry full-time in the future.
