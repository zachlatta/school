# 3.3.8 Discuss: Think It Through Talk It Out

## Assignment

Read the statement below then decide whether you agree or disagree with it. Be
prepared to support your opinion with details from the speeches. Here's your
discussion prompt:

> Had Al Gore used media in his presentation, his speech would have been less
> dignified.

What do you think? Write a paragraph supporting your opinion and then write a
reply paragraph. If you're working with others, your reply paragraph should
respond to the ideas of another student. If you're working alone, your reply
paragraph should support the opposite point of view from your own.

## Response

I agree with the provided statement. Gore is giving his speech in the context
of an overly formal environment. Incorporating media, would be inappropriate
for the situation, lessening the credibility and dignity of his speech. For
example, Dan Pink uses a casual tone in his _Drive: The Surprising Truth About
What Motivates Us_ talk to relate closely to the listener. Gore doesn't need
to do this because his speech is not about relatability as much as it is about
communicating raw information.

I disagree with your agreement. Despite the formal situation, Gore could have
gone above and beyond and connected with his audience to make a deeper and more
meaningful impact through the use of media. In his talk, Pink effectively uses
visuals to make a deep and memorable impact with his audience, making his
message far more impactful.
