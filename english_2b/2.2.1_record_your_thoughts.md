# 2.2.1 Journal: Record Your Thoughts

## Assignment

Did the statement "There's a gorilla in the next room" become a fact for you at
any point when you read the list? Explain whether it did or didn't and why.
Then consider what it would take for you to declare any piece of information an
actual fact.

## Response

The statement "There's a gorilla in the next room" at no point became an
absolute fact to me. Idioms are inherently subjective. I believe that it isn't
possible to accurately and consistently understand the meaning of idioms
because context is a vital part of their meaning. For example, my mother once
said, "It's raining cats and dogs." Without context, I don't know if she was
referring to heavy rain or if cats and dogs were literally falling from the
sky.
