# 4.1.1 Journal: Record Your Thoughts

## Assignment

Explain your position on each of the following arguments: English should be
the official language of the United States, Americans shouldn't be allowed
to drive until they are 18, and students in public schools should be
required to wear uniforms. Write at least two sentences for each issue.

## Response

## English should be the official language of the United States

We are a nation of immigrants. To say that certain origins are more "American"
than others undermines the very meaning of our nation. Endorsing English as the
official language of the United States would do that.

## Americans shouldn't be allowed to drive until they are 18

Driving requires motor skills, training, and maturity. As time has shown, age
isn't necessarily the best measure of motor skills, ability to be trained, or,
most importantly, maturity. I believe that Americans should be able to drive
when under 18 because of this.

## Students in public schools should be required to wear uniforms

I like to consider myself a relatively active member of the startup community.
In the startup world, it is common to go to work in sandals and t-shirts are
the norm. As the startup community has shown, enforced attire does not
necessarily increase productivity or make the work and learning environment
more focused. Because of this, I don't believe students in public schools
should be required to wear uniforms.
