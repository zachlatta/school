# 2.1.1 Journal: Record Your Thoughts

## Assignment

Write about a time when a person (you, for example) got into trouble because of
the tone of his or her voice, whether with parents, teachers, authorities, or
someone else.

## Response

One time I emailed a teacher using informal language about a homework
assignment. Instead of getting an answer to my question in the response, they
scolded me for my language choice. Only after correcting my language did they
answer my homework question. This exchange was a pivotal point in my
communications life and taught me the true importance of tone. Using the wrong
tone can potentially offend the reader and detract from your original intent.
