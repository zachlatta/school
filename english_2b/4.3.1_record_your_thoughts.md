# 4.3.1 Journal: Record Your Thoughts

## Assignment

Describe your strengths and weaknesses as a writer and researcher. What do you
think you most need to work on as you revise and edit the rough draft? What do
you have confidence about?

## Response

I'm confident in my ability to research and incorporate new information into my
claims. However, I'm less than confident in my ability to express my thoughts
in a very structured format. I worry that I'll lose the personality of my
writing when conforming it to a predefined structure, a process somewhat
analogous to worrying about losing the smooth and unique grains of a tree when
cutting it into a predefined shape, say the leg of a chair. As they say,
practice makes perfect and working on more rigid assignments will improve my
ability to work within predefined limits.

As I revise and edit the rough draft, I should primarily look out for coherency
and maintaining the overall strength of my paper. I think the motive behind my
argument is strong and will help the strength of the paper as a whole.
