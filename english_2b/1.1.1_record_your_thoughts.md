# 1.1.1 Journal: Record Your Thoughts

## Before

First, I got out of my bed. Second, I checked Hacker News and was disappointed
that it was offline. Third, I fixed a bug in an IRC robot I'm working on.
Fourth, I added a small feature to a website I'm creating. Fifth, I checked my
email.

## After

I live and breathe technology. I started my day today by checking Hacker News,
fixing a bug in an IRC robot, checking my email, and adding a feature to one of
my websites.
