# 1.3.8 Discuss: Think It Through, Talk It Out

## Assignment

Read the statement below and decide whether you agree or disagree with it. Be
prepared to support your opinion with details from the reading. Here's your
discussion prompt:

> When you write cover letters, confidence is the most important quality to
> project, and it is O.K. to brag about yourself.

What do you think? Write a paragraph supporting your opinion and then write a
reply paragraph. If you're working with others, your reply paragraph should
respond to the ideas of another student. If you're working alone, your reply
paragraph should support the opposite point of view from your own.

## Response

Cover letters are your chance to pitch yourself. It is perfectly acceptable to
be confident and brag about your skillset. For example, in Mr. Covington's
cover letter to H.T. Lloyd and Sons, he says, "My qualifications include a BA
in general studies from the University of Southern Wichita, where I graduated
cum laude." This sentence exerts confidence making the application more serious
and more appealing. As an employer, I don't want employees that aren't
confident in their skillset.

Despite confidence and bragging on a cover letter may not initially sounding
like a bad thing, it will quickly and thoroughly devolve into egotism. As an
employer, I want employees confident in their skillset, but not those with
egotistic urges. Encouraging bragging on cover letters encourages those with
egotistic urges.
